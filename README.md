3D reconstruction of the liver for volume measurement and 3D visual shape
analysis using an accessible medical imaging modality like ultrasound (US)
imaging is important. We present the first method capable of reconstructing
liver from few partial Ultrasound scans aquired at midline, midclavicular line
and anterior-auxillay line. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated deep learning method
that calculates the liver volume from three incomplete 2D US scans. Further,
we introduce a new US liver database with parallel, annotated CT scans
comprising 134 scans.Our volumetry results are statistically closer to the ground-truth volumes
obtained from CT scans than the volumes computed by radiologists using the
Childsâ€™ method.

## Running

### 1. Download Google pre-trained ViT models
* [Get models in this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/vit_models/): R50-ViT-B_16, ViT-B_16, ViT-L_16...
```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/vit_models/imagenet21k/{MODEL_NAME}.npz &&
mkdir ../model/vit_checkpoint/imagenet21k &&
mv {MODEL_NAME}.npz ../model/vit_checkpoint/imagenet21k/{MODEL_NAME}.npz
```

### 2. Prepare data (All data are available!)

All data are available so no need to send emails for data. Please use the [BTCV preprocessed data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACJEoTp-uqfFJ73qS3eUObQh52nGuzCd?usp=sharing) and [ACDC data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KQcrci7aKsYZi1hQoZ3T3QUtcy7b--n4?usp=drive_link).

### 3. Environment

Please prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

### 4. Train/Test

- Run the train script on synapse dataset. The batch size can be reduced to 12 or 6 to save memory (please also decrease the base_lr linearly), and both can reach similar performance.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --dataset Synapse --vit_name R50-ViT-B_16
```

- Run the test script on synapse dataset. It supports testing for both 2D images and 3D volumes.

```bash
python test.py --dataset Synapse --vit_name R50-ViT-B_16
```
