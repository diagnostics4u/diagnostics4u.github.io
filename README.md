3D reconstruction of the liver for volume measurement and 3D visual shape
analysis using an accessible medical imaging modality like ultrasound (US)
imaging is important. We present the first method capable of reconstructing
liver from few partial Ultrasound scans aquired at midline, midclavicular line
and anterior-auxillay line. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated deep learning method
that calculates the liver volume from three incomplete 2D US scans. Further,
we introduce a new US liver database with parallel, annotated CT scans
comprising 134 scans.Our volumetry results are statistically closer to the ground-truth volumes
obtained from CT scans than the volumes computed by radiologists using the
Childsâ€™ method.

## Running

### 1. Download Google pre-trained ViT model
* [Download R50-ViT-B_16 models in this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/vit_models/): R50-ViT-B_16
* Move the downloaded model to folder `./model/vit_checkpoint/imagenet21k/` and rename it to `R50-ViT-B_16.npz`

### 2. Prepare data

* Inference datasets will be available soon.

<!-- [BTCV preprocessed data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACJEoTp-uqfFJ73qS3eUObQh52nGuzCd?usp=sharing)  -->

### 3. Download liver dataset SSM information

* The SSM information will be available soon.
* Once you download the SSM information, place it in the folder `./SSM/`

<!-- * [Download SSM information](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACJEoTp-uqfFJ73qS3eUObQh52nGuzCd?usp=sharing) -->

### 4. Environment

* Create an environment with python=3.7 and install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Train/Test

* Run the inference_liverusrecon script on the downloaded dataset. 
  
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference_liverusrecon.py --inference {dataset path} --save {results path} --info {info path}
```
