It is crucial to use an accessible medical imaging modality like ultrasound (US) imaging to reconstruct the liver in three dimensions for the purpose of measuring its volume and analyzing its visual shape. We offer the first technique that can reconstruct the liver from a small number of partial ultrasound scans obtained at the anterior-auxillay, midline, and midclavicular lines.
